Hey reader! idk how you got here but my name is Travis.
the school I go to is called hstat because we are too lazy to say the full name :)
hmmm what would you like to know.... Well for starters I'm a pretty chill guy, especially with this weather being so cold 
(see what i did there? ^-^)
if you ever need to find me (highly unlikely) or want to follow me for no reason (because thats not creepy at all) or simply never want to see me and intend to deliberately avoid me after that corny pun here is my schedule:

1st Spanish
2nd Play production 
3rd AP compisition 
4th physics 
5th algebra 
6th Lunch 
7th software
8th US History
