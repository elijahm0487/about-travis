## Hey reader!  
I have no clue as to how you got here but my name is Travis. And here are some things about me!  
hmmm what would you like to know....   
* Well for starters I'm a pretty _chill_ guy, especially with this weather being so cold (see what i did there? ^-^)
* If you missed it, my name is Matos, Travis Matos...
  * And in case you were wondering about my middle name (because who wouldn't) My middle name is Guy. Yes... Its ACTUALLY Guy. Short, simple and straight to the point.
* OH and the school I go to is called **HSTAT** because we are too lazy to say the full name :)
* if you ever need to find me (highly unlikely) or want to follow me for no reason (because thats not creepy at all) or simply never want to see me and intend to deliberately avoid me after that corny pun here is my schedule:

Well, although its been fun I gotta go do something that does not involve computer screens before my eyeballs fall out 
It was nice talking to you though!  
Im sorry did you want to say something? I feel like its been a one way conversation (especially if you ACTUALLY read this far)
